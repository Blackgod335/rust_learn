🦀 Rust Programming Language
📌 What is Rust?

Rust is a modern systems programming language focused on:

⚡ Performance

🔒 Memory Safety

🧵 Concurrency

Rust achieves these goals without using a garbage collector, making it ideal for performance-critical applications.

Its syntax is similar to C++, but Rust provides stronger guarantees around memory safety while maintaining high performance.

🚀 Why Use Rust?

Rust is designed to solve common systems programming challenges such as memory management and concurrency issues.

🔹 Key Features

🛡 Memory safety without garbage collection

⚙️ Zero-cost abstractions

🧵 Fearless concurrency

🚀 High performance

🧠 Strong and expressive type system

👨‍💻 History

Rust was originally created by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions from Brendan Eich (creator of JavaScript).

Developers choose Rust because it provides:

Safety without sacrificing speed

Modern tooling

Excellent compiler diagnostics

Reliable concurrent programming

🛠 Installing Rust & Cargo

To install Rust and its package manager Cargo, visit:

👉 https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/

Cargo helps you:

Create new projects

Manage dependencies

Build and run your code

Publish crates

📚 Language Basics

Rust basics include fundamental programming concepts necessary for writing effective programs.

🧩 Core Concepts

Syntax and semantics

Variables

Constants

Data types

Control flow (loops & conditionals)

Functions

These concepts form the foundation of Rust programming and help structure reusable, maintainable code.

📖 Syntax and Semantics

Rust’s syntax is clean and expressive, while its semantics ensure strict safety guarantees at compile time.

Each file inside the Basics/syntax folder demonstrates:

1.variables.rs → Variable declaration and mutability

2.data_types.rs → Primitive and compound data types
